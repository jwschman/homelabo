## Notes

### Missing Longhorn Volume

I set up Redmine before I began using declarative volumes in Longhorn so it does not yet have its own `storage.yaml`. (copied from Redmine `readme.md`)

**Update 11/4/2005:** Switched from the bitnami helm chart to official images and also switched the storage to declarative volumes in the process.
