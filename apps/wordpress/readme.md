# wordpress

I use an internal only WordPress instance basically as a journal that I keep for myself.  I like to play around with it and do writeups for various things that are happening in my life.  It will never be made public, but some posts that I start on it may wind up as posts on [my github.io site](jwschman.github.io) if they fit there as well.
