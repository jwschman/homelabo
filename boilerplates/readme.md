# boilerplates

Contains my boilerplate manifests.  I got tired of hunting down existing resources to copy from so I created this central place to store them.

## Current Resource Boilerplates

- `storage.yaml` - creates a longhorn volume with corresponding PV and PVC
- `externalsecret.yaml` - creates an ExternalSecret to be pulled from Vault

## TODO

- Add boilerplates for ingress, services, etc
- The creation of some of these can actually be handled by shell scripts
