# testing

A place for temporary manifests used to poke around the cluster, test stuff, or debug things like Longhorn storage.  Having the premade manifests makes deploying and, more importantly, cleanup easy with `kubectl apply` and `kubectl delete`.

Parameters inside the pod definitions here will change depending on what I was playing with most recently.
